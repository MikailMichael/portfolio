                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>My name is Mikail Deveden. I am a passionate aspiring programmer keen on learning many different aspects of software development. I am a Full-Stack Engineer
                       and am currently most profficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++ and C#; although I also intend to learn Python very soon.</p>
                    <p>I love coding and find myself doing it more than anything else right now in my spare time. My current goal is to make a classic 2D turn based RPG game in the Unity 
                       game engine, as games are my other hobby I indulge in. Outside of those, I enjoy physical fitness, horror movies, table top RPGs such as D&D and anime.</p>
                    <p>I'm interested in all things code. Whether it's making a website or a game, I will enjoy it. Especially if there are challenging novel features you intend to implemnet.</p>

                    <h2>Current Project: My 2D RPG Unity Game</h2>
                    <p>My current passion project that I work on every oppurtunity I get. It is a 2D turn based RPG made with the Unity engine, and is inspired by many games I would consider
                       classics, such as Chrono Trigger, Final Fantsy III, Super Mario RPG - Legend of the Seven Stars and Bravely Default to name a few.</p>
